## 📝 Feature 1: File Rename

### Implementation Details

**Menu Integration:**
- Added button "📝 文件重命名" to main menu
- Callback data: `rename_start`
- Positioned in new row before VIP menu

**Handler Methods:**
```python
handle_rename_start(query)              # Start the rename flow
handle_rename_file_upload(update, context, document)  # Process uploaded file
handle_rename_newname_input(update, context, user_id, text)  # Process new filename
cleanup_rename_task(user_id)            # Clean up temp files and status
```

**Helper Functions:**
```python
sanitize_filename(filename: str) -> str  # Clean filename, remove illegal chars
send_document_safely(chat_id, file_path, caption, filename) -> bool  # Send with retry
```

**User Status Flow:**
1. `waiting_rename_file` - Waiting for file upload
2. `waiting_rename_newname` - Waiting for new filename input
3. Reset to "" - Task complete

**Data Structure:**
```python
self.pending_rename[user_id] = {
    'temp_dir': str,      # Temporary directory path
    'file_path': str,     # Full path to downloaded file
    'orig_name': str,     # Original filename
    'ext': str            # File extension (with dot)
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Supports any file type
- ✅ Preserves original extension
- ✅ Sanitizes illegal characters: `<>:"/\|?*`
- ✅ Length limit: 200 characters
- ✅ Auto cleanup on completion/error
- ✅ 5-minute timeout protection
- ✅ Retry handling for RetryAfter errors

## 🧩 Feature 2: Account Merge

### Implementation Details

**Menu Integration:**
- Added button "🧩 账户合并" to main menu
- Callback data: `merge_start`, `merge_finish`
- Positioned next to File Rename button

**Handler Methods:**
```python
handle_merge_start(query)               # Start the merge flow
handle_merge_file_upload(update, context, document)  # Process each file upload
handle_merge_finish(update, context, query)  # Trigger processing
process_merge_files(update, context, user_id)  # Background processing (async)
is_tdata_zip(zip_path: str) -> bool     # Detect TData ZIPs
cleanup_merge_task(user_id)             # Clean up temp files and status
```

**User Status Flow:**
1. `waiting_merge_files` - Accepting file uploads
2. Processing in background thread
3. Reset to "" - Task complete

**Data Structure:**
```python
self.pending_merge[user_id] = {
    'temp_dir': str,      # Temporary directory path
    'files': List[str]    # List of uploaded filenames
}
```

**Detection & Classification:**

1. **TData ZIP Detection:**
   - Inspects ZIP contents
   - Looks for `D877F783D5D3EF8C` directory marker
   - Marks as TData if found

2. **Session+JSON Pairing:**
   - Extracts basenames (filename without extension)
   - Matches `.session` with `.json` of same basename
   - Groups paired files together

3. **Categories:**
   - TData ZIPs → `tdata_only_{timestamp}.zip`
   - Paired Session+JSON → `session_json_pairs_{timestamp}.zip`
   - Everything else → `incomplete_{timestamp}.zip`

**Processing:**
- ✅ Concurrent background processing with asyncio
- ✅ Multiple file upload support
- ✅ Smart categorization
- ✅ Automatic ZIP packaging
- ✅ Progress feedback
- ✅ Auto cleanup

**Supported File Types:**
- `.zip` - TData archives or other ZIPs
- `.session` - Telegram session files
- `.json` - Configuration files

## 🔧 Core Changes to TGapibot.py

### 1. Class Initialization (Line ~4865)
```python
# Added two new task dictionaries
self.pending_rename: Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
self.pending_merge: Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
```

### 2. Main Menu Update (Line ~5092)
```python
# Added new button row
[
    InlineKeyboardButton("📝 文件重命名", callback_data="rename_start"),
    InlineKeyboardButton("🧩 账户合并", callback_data="merge_start")
],
```

### 3. Callback Routing (Line ~6076)
```python
elif data == "rename_start":
    self.handle_rename_start(query)
elif data == "merge_start":
    self.handle_merge_start(query)
elif data == "merge_finish":
    self.handle_merge_finish(update, context, query)
```

### 4. File Handler Update (Line ~6970)
```python
# Modified to accept non-ZIP files for rename/merge
if user_status == "waiting_rename_file":
    self.handle_rename_file_upload(update, context, document)
    return
elif user_status == "waiting_merge_files":
    self.handle_merge_file_upload(update, context, document)
    return
```

### 5. Text Handler Update (Line ~8318)
```python
# Added handler for rename filename input
elif user_status == "waiting_rename_newname":
    self.handle_rename_newname_input(update, context, user_id, text)
    return
```

### 6. Helper Methods (Line ~4981)
```python
def sanitize_filename(filename: str) -> str:
    # Removes illegal characters, limits length, handles edge cases

def send_document_safely(chat_id, file_path, caption, filename) -> bool:
    # Sends document with RetryAfter handling
```

### 7. Feature Implementation (Line ~10859)
```python
# Complete implementations for both features
# - handle_rename_start
# - handle_rename_file_upload
# - handle_rename_newname_input
# - cleanup_rename_task
# - handle_merge_start
# - handle_merge_file_upload
# - handle_merge_finish
# - process_merge_files
# - is_tdata_zip

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Design Decisions

1. **Menu-based vs Command-based**
   - Chose menu buttons for better UX
   - More discoverable for users
   - Consistent with existing features

2. **Status Management**
   - Reused existing database status field
   - Simple and consistent with other features
   - Easy to debug and monitor

3. **Background Processing**
   - Used threading + asyncio for merge
   - Prevents blocking other users
   - Allows for progress updates

4. **Cleanup Strategy**
   - Explicit cleanup methods
   - Called in finally blocks
   - Timeout protection for abandoned tasks

### Challenges Solved

1. **F-string with Emoji**
   - Issue: Syntax error with emoji in f-string quotes
   - Solution: Used regular string instead of f-string for that part

2. **File Handler Routing**
   - Issue: Existing handler required ZIP files
   - Solution: Early return for rename/merge before ZIP check

3. **Concurrent User Tasks**
   - Issue: Task isolation between users
   - Solution: User-specific temp directories and dict keys
