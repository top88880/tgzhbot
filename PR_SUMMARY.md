# Fix Unresponsive Broadcast Wizard Buttons - PR Summary

## 📋 Overview

This PR fixes the unresponsive broadcast wizard buttons and finalizes the zh-CN two-column broadcast UI with robust callback routing and media input handling in TGapibot.py.

## 🐛 Problem

Several broadcast wizard buttons were not responding when tapped:
- 媒体 (Media)
- 文本 (Text)
- 按钮 (Buttons)
- 完整预览 (Full Preview)
- 返回 (Back)
- 下一步 (Next)

### Root Causes
1. Missing CallbackQueryHandler registration for broadcast_* pattern
2. Mis-ordered handler registration (generic before specific)
3. No routing for new broadcast actions
4. Missing query.answer() safety acknowledgments
5. No media upload support

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Dedicated Callback Handler
```python
# Added BEFORE generic handler (priority)
self.dp.add_handler(CallbackQueryHandler(
    self.handle_broadcast_callbacks_router, 
    pattern=r"^broadcast_"
))
```

### 2. Comprehensive Dispatch Table
```python
dispatch_table = {
    # Main menu
    "broadcast_menu": λ show_broadcast_menu(),
    "broadcast_create": λ start_broadcast_wizard(),
    
    # Media operations (NEW)
    "broadcast_media": λ handle_broadcast_media(),
    "broadcast_media_view": λ handle_broadcast_media_view(),
    "broadcast_media_clear": λ handle_broadcast_media_clear(),
    
    # Text operations (NEW)
    "broadcast_text": λ handle_broadcast_text(),
    "broadcast_text_view": λ handle_broadcast_text_view(),
    
    # Button operations (NEW)
    "broadcast_buttons": λ handle_broadcast_buttons(),
    "broadcast_buttons_view": λ handle_broadcast_buttons_view(),
    "broadcast_buttons_clear": λ handle_broadcast_buttons_clear(),
    
    # Navigation (NEW)
    "broadcast_preview": λ handle_broadcast_preview(),
    "broadcast_back": λ handle_broadcast_back(),
    "broadcast_next": λ handle_broadcast_next(),
}
```

### 3. Safety Mechanisms
```python
# Always call query.answer() with try/except
try:
    query.answer()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️ query.answer() failed: {e}")

# Admin permission check
if not self.db.is_admin(user_id):
    query.answer("❌ Admin only", show_alert=True)
    return

# Error handling in dispatch
try:
    dispatch_table[data]()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Handler failed [{data}]: {e}")
    safe_edit_message(query, f"❌ Error: {str(e)[:100]}")
```

### 4. Two-Column UI
```

✅/⚪ 文本: 已设置/未设置
✅/⚪ 按钮: N 个

```

### 5. Media Upload Support
- Photo handler: `MessageHandler(Filters.photo, handle_photo)`
- Media storage: `task['media_file_id']`
- Preview with media: `send_photo(caption=content)`

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
$ python3 test_broadcast_routing.py
============================================================
🧪 Broadcast Callback Routing Test
============================================================
✅ Dedicated broadcast CallbackQueryHandler found
✅ Broadcast handler before generic handler
✅ All 15 required actions in dispatch table
✅ query.answer() wrapped in try/except
✅ All 13 required methods implemented
✅ Photo handler registered
✅ Two-column UI with all required buttons
============================================================
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
============================================================
```

### Syntax Validation
```bash
$ python3 -m py_compile TGapibot.py
# No errors
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before ❌
```
User clicks [📸 媒体]
  → No callback handler
  → No response
  → Button appears stuck
  → User frustrated
```

### After ✅
```
User clicks [📸 媒体]
  → Caught by broadcast handler (pattern: ^broadcast_)
  → query.answer() called
  → handle_broadcast_media() executed
  → Prompt for photo upload shown
  → User uploads photo
  → Photo saved to task
  → Returns to editor with ✅ status
  → Success!
```
